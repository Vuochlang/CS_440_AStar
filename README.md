Given the astar folder:

In the astar.pyy, implement the 2 methods that are unimplemented:
  
    _ method 1: def successors(self, state),
        Given a state, find its successors which are the edges connect states in cardinal directions and diagonals. Then 
        calculate the cost between two adjacent nodes which is the successor state and the given state.</p>
    
    _  method 2: def search(self, initialstate, costlimit=None, quiet=True)
        implement the A* search algorithm with the given "initialstate"
